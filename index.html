<p>This site describes the different components of a multimodal architecture for education</p>

<h3>Drivers</h3>

Drivers of this architecture are based on HCI approaches, <b> the teacher' pedagogical intentions </b> are elicit via a Rule-editor where the <b>Assessment Criteria </b>can be defined in a way that the system can understand what needs to be done to provide eviddence based on teachers expectations.

The analysis is also guided based on the <b> Learning Objectives </b>. Each learning activity is designed with the intention to support certain Learning Objectives, for example, in our context nurses are learning to 'identify early signs of patient deterioration and react to them'. Because of that, teachers expectations are based on the type of actions that nurses can perform and the timeliness of actions. The critical actions are normally define based on the learning task.

Specific </b>Higher Order Constructs</b> can be used in order to interrogate and provide meaning to raw level data. From previous research we have identified some constructs of interest. For the Nursing context constructs such patient-care, leadership or stress can be of interest to explore. Aditionallly, other constructs are normally attached to the modality of analysis. For instance, for positioning, certain constructs such proximity, f-formations or spaces of interest were used to provide additional meaning to low-level data.

Thus, other constructs can be analysed based on the learning context and the modality that is beeing analysed (physiological data, video, audio, actions and so on).
